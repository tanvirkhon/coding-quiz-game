# Coding Quiz Application

The application works in the following way:

As soon as the user clicks on the start button the timer for the quiz will start. The user will have 25 seconds in total to complete the quiz.

If the user gets the question right they will move on to the next question without a time penalty.

If they get the answer wrong they will still move on to the next question by but suffer a 5 second time penalty.

If at any point the user completes the questions in the quiz or the timer runs out they will be presented with an end screen where their score will be listed. The user will also be able to input their name and score.
